# Double IPA (Imperial IPA) — Style Doctrine

## Core Philosophy
- Hop saturation on a dry, highly fermentable base.
- Alcohol supports hops; it must not dominate.
- Finish must be dry enough to prevent sweetness perception.
- Bitterness should be firm but not harsh.
- Drinkability at high ABV is the goal.

## Grain Philosophy
- 80–90% 2-row or high-quality pale base malt.
- Optional 5–10% Munich for light malt depth.
- Sugar (5–10%) often used to improve dryness and attenuation.
- Crystal minimal or omitted (≤3–5% if used).

Avoid:
- Heavy crystal stacking.
- High dextrin malts.
- Excess body-building grains.

## Fermentation Doctrine
Yeast:
- Clean American strain preferred.
- High attenuation, low ester.

Pitching & oxygen:
- Adequate pitch rate for high gravity.
- Oxygenate at knockout (do not re-oxygenate after fermentation starts).

Temperature schedule:
- Start: 64–66°F (18–19°C).
- Allow rise to 68–70°F (20–21°C).
- Avoid excessive heat that increases ester production.

Attenuation target:
- Apparent attenuation: 78–85%.
- FG often 1.008–1.014 depending on OG.
- FG > 1.016 commonly reads as “sweet” and blunts bitterness.

## Water Philosophy
- Sulfate-forward.
- Ca ~100–150 ppm typical.
- SO4 often ~200–300 ppm.
- Cl lower (40–100 ppm depending on desired balance).
- Avoid excessive sodium.

Avoid:
- Extreme sulfate that creates harshness.
- Soft/chloride-heavy profiles unless intentionally brewing a different IPA subtype.

## Hop Strategy Doctrine
Bittering:
- Clean high-alpha hop early in boil for firm structure.

Late hop focus:
- Whirlpool at 170–185°F (77–85°C) for oil retention.
- Aggressive dry hopping; manage contact time to reduce hop creep risk.

## Oxidation Doctrine (Critical)
Double IPA is highly oxygen sensitive.
Cold-side oxygen causes:
- Aroma collapse.
- Dull bitterness.
- Darkening/orange shift.
- “Honey-like” oxidative character.

Safeguards:
- Closed transfers.
- Purge headspace when possible.
- Minimize oxygen exposure during dry hop.
- Avoid splashing post-fermentation.

## Flavor Targets
Aroma:
- High to very high hop intensity; variety-driven descriptors.
- No grassy/vegetal.

Flavor:
- Strong hop flavor with firm bitterness.
- Clean fermentation.
- Dry finish.

Mouthfeel:
- Medium-light to medium; not syrupy.
- Alcohol warming but smooth.

Carbonation:
- 2.3–2.6 volumes CO₂ typical.

## Common Non-Professional Errors
- Too much crystal malt.
- High FG / under-attenuation.
- Ester-forward fermentation.
- Harsh sulfate bite.
- Oxidation during dry hop/packaging.
- Hop burn from excessive/poorly managed dry hop.

## Competition Deduction Risks
- Sweet finish.
- Harsh bitterness.
- Hop burn.
- Oxidized aroma.
- Alcohol heat.
- Insufficient hop intensity for category.
