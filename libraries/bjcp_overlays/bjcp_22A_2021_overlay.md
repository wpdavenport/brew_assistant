# BJCP 2021 Overlay — 22A Double IPA

Purpose:
- Constrain recipe/process choices to BJCP 2021 22A expectations.
- Highlight judge-facing boundary risks and common deductions.
- Use with libraries/beer_research/22A_double_ipa.md.

## Parameter Guardrails
OG: 1.065–1.085
FG: 1.008–1.018
IBU: 60–120
SRM: 6–14
ABV: 7.5–10.0%

## Sensory Intensity Targets (relative)
- Hop aroma: High–Very High
- Hop flavor: High–Very High
- Bitterness: High (but clean)
- Malt: Medium-low to Medium (supportive, not dominant)
- Ester: Low
- Alcohol warmth: Medium-low to Medium (smooth, not hot)
- Carbonation: Medium

## Style Boundary Traps (judge risk)

- Sweet finish → often from high FG or excessive crystal
- Harsh bitterness → excessive sulfate or poor bittering balance
- Hop burn → excessive dry hop load or insufficient conditioning
- Oxidation → dull aroma, honey note, color shift
- Ester-forward fermentation → clashes with hop profile
- Alcohol heat → poor fermentation temperature control
- Underwhelming hop intensity for gravity level

## Common Deductions & Prevention Focus

1) Sweet Finish
   - Target high attenuation
   - Limit crystal
   - Consider sugar addition for dryness
   - Ensure mash temperature promotes fermentability

2) Harsh Bitterness
   - Avoid extreme sulfate
   - Use clean bittering hops
   - Control hop timing for smooth perception

3) Hop Burn
   - Manage dry hop contact time
   - Avoid excessive vegetal matter
   - Allow short conditioning period before judging

4) Oxidation
   - Strict cold-side oxygen control
   - Closed transfers
   - Minimal headspace

5) Alcohol Heat
   - Start fermentation cool
   - Ensure proper pitch rate and oxygenation

## Competition-Focused Process Flags

- FG above ~1.016 at moderate OG risks sweetness perception.
- Sulfate > ~350 ppm increases harshness risk.
- Dry hop > ~5 oz per 5 gal without management increases hop burn risk.
- Fermentation temp > 70°F early increases ester/alcohol risk.
