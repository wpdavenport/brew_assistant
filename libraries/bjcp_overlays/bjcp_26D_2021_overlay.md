# BJCP 2021 Overlay — 26D Belgian Dark Strong Ale

Purpose:
- Constrain recipe/process choices to BJCP 2021 26D expectations.
- Highlight judge-facing boundary risks and common deductions.
- This file is NOT a style doctrine. Use with libraries/beer_research/26D_belgian_dark_strong.md.

## Parameter Guardrails (use as constraints)
OG: 1.075–1.110
FG: 1.010–1.024
IBU: 20–35
SRM: 12–22
ABV: 8.0–12.0%

## Sensory Intensity Targets (relative)
- Ester: Medium–High (dark fruit-forward)
- Phenols: Low–Medium (spice possible; should not dominate)
- Malt: Medium–High (rich, but not cloying)
- Bitterness: Medium-low to Medium (supporting balance)
- Alcohol warmth: Medium-low to Medium (smooth, not hot)
- Carbonation: High

## Style Boundary Traps (judge risk)
- Too sweet / under-attenuated → reads heavy, “cloying,” “finishes sweet”
- Too hot / solventy → fusels from early high temp or stressed yeast
- Too much roast → can drift toward porter/stout character (should be dark-fruit/caramel, not roasty)
- Too much crystal → “caramel-heavy,” “muddy,” reduced drinkability
- Too low carbonation → “heavy,” “flabby,” sweetness emphasized

## Common Deductions & Prevention Focus
1) Sweet finish
   - Ensure fermentability (mash, sugar strategy), strong yeast health, warm finish for completion
2) Alcohol heat
   - Controlled start temp, healthy pitch, adequate oxygenation, avoid nutrient deficiency
3) Muddy malt complexity
   - Keep specialty malts restrained; let yeast/sugar provide complexity
4) Oxidation / aged sweetness
   - Oxygen control on transfers and packaging; minimize headspace
5) Low carbonation
   - Target high CO2; ensure packaging method can reliably hit it

## Competition-Focused Process Flags
- If FG is above ~1.020 at typical 1.090 OG, treat “sweet finish” as likely.
- If fermentation temp exceeded ~75°F (24°C) early, treat fusel risk as elevated.
- If roast malt > small accent level, treat “out of style” risk as elevated.
