# BJCP 2021 Overlay — 34A Clone Beer

Purpose:
- Constrain recipe/process choices to BJCP 2021 34A expectations.
- Highlight judge-facing boundary risks and common deductions.
- This file is NOT style doctrine. Use with the declared target beer and base-style doctrine.
- 34A is fidelity judged: the beer is scored on how closely it matches the declared commercial example.

## Entry Guardrails (Critical)
- Must declare the commercial example (beer name + brewery).
- Must declare the base style (for example, 22A Double IPA for a DFH 90 Minute clone).
- Judges assess similarity to the declared target; "just a good beer" is not enough in this category.
- If declaration details are vague/incomplete, expect avoidable score loss.

## Parameter Guardrails
BJCP 34A does not define universal OG/FG/IBU/SRM/ABV limits.
Use the declared commercial target plus base-style constraints.

Working clone window for this repo when target is Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA (not BJCP limits):
- OG: 1.088–1.092
- FG: 1.014–1.018
- IBU: 80–95
- SRM: 8–11
- ABV: 8.8–9.5%

## Sensory Intensity Targets (relative, DFH 90 target)
- Hop aroma: High (resin/citrus/floral), not modern "juice bomb"
- Hop flavor: High with layered boil-derived bitterness structure
- Bitterness: High and firm, but smooth (not sulfate-sharp)
- Malt: Medium support with light caramel/honey impression
- Ester: Low to Medium-low
- Alcohol warmth: Medium-low to Medium (smooth, not hot)
- Carbonation: Medium

## Style Boundary Traps (judge risk)
- Too far from clone target profile (even if technically excellent)
- Modern West Coast drift: too dry, too lean, too dry-hop-dominant
- Harsh bitterness: sulfate overuse or rough bittering balance
- Sweet finish: under-attenuation or excess crystal
- Hop burn/vegetal: over-dry-hopping or poor contact management
- Oxidation: aroma dulling, honey/stale note, color darkening
- Entry form mismatch: declared target/base style not aligned with beer presented

## Common Deductions & Prevention Focus
1) Clone mismatch
   - Build from declared commercial target first, then tune process
   - Calibrate using side-by-side tastings against fresh commercial example

2) Bitterness quality mismatch
   - Prioritize boil structure and smoothness over only late-hop saturation
   - Keep sulfate in a firm but controlled range

3) Finish mismatch
   - Control attenuation to match target dryness
   - Avoid both cloying finish and over-dry modern profile

4) Aroma mismatch
   - Keep hop selection/process aligned to target-era profile
   - Avoid over-indexing on contemporary dry-hop intensity
   - Keep packaging-to-judging window tight to preserve target freshness

5) Procedural entry errors
   - Declare commercial example clearly
   - Declare base style clearly and consistently

## Competition-Focused Process Flags
- If the declared commercial example is missing, treat score ceiling as reduced.
- If base style is not declared, treat judge alignment risk as elevated.
- If FG is below ~1.012 for DFH 90 target, risk "too dry / not clone-like."
- If sulfate is above ~250 ppm for DFH 90 target, risk harshness and clone drift.
- If dry hop is very high relative to kettle bitterness, risk modern IPA drift vs clone intent.
- If the packaged beer is stale by judging, treat clone-match risk as elevated even with correct recipe design.
