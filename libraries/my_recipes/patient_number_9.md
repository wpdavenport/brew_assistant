### Dry Hop (Clone-safe, not modern overkill)
- 1.0 oz Amarillo
- 1.0 oz Simcoe
- Timing: add when gravity is within 2-4 points of terminal (typically day 5-6), contact 48-72 hours, then crash.

## YEAST
- WLP007 Dry English Ale

## WATER PROFILE (RO SOURCE)
Total brewing liquor for this recipe: 9.5 gal.

Target ions (approx):
- Ca: ~110 ppm
- Mg: ~8 ppm
- Na: ~0 ppm
- SO4: ~225-230 ppm
- Cl: ~50 ppm
- HCO3: ~0 ppm

Salt additions for 9.5 gal total liquor:
- 0.45 oz Gypsum (CaSO4)
- 0.10 oz Epsom Salt (MgSO4)
- 0.13 oz Calcium Chloride (CaCl2)
- 0.00 oz Baking Soda

## BREW DAY PROCESS (FULL-VOLUME NO-SPARGE)
1. Measure 9.5 gal total RO liquor.
2. Add all salts to the total liquor and mix thoroughly.
3. Heat to strike temp and mash in.
4. Mash 75 minutes at 150 F.
5. Mash out 10 minutes at 168 F.
6. After 10-15 minutes into mash, cool sample and measure pH.
7. Adjust with 85% phosphoric acid only as needed, in 1 ml increments, stir, wait 5 minutes, recheck.
8. Boil 90 minutes and run hop schedule as written.
9. Add 1.25 lb corn sugar at 10 minutes left in the boil.

## FERMENTATION SCHEDULE
1. Chill and pitch at 65 F.
2. Hold 65 F for days 0-3.
3. Raise to 67-68 F for days 4-7 or until terminal gravity.
4. Add dry hops near terminal gravity, hold 48-72 hours at 67-68 F.
5. Cold crash to 38 F immediately after dry hop contact window.

## PACKAGING + CLONE SCORING CHECKPOINTS
- Closed transfer only to fully purged keg.
- Keep oxygen exposure minimal during dry hop and transfer.
- Carbonation target: medium (about 2.3-2.5 vols CO2).
- Validate against fresh commercial sample side-by-side before entry submission.
- Entry form must include exact commercial target + brewery + base style.

## CRITICAL RISKS TO AVOID
- Harshness from excess sulfate or high mash pH.
- Oxidation during dry hop/packaging.
- Over-dry finish that drifts away from clone profile.
- Excess ester/alcohol heat from warm early fermentation.
