# Manhattan Belgian Dark Strong Ale

## INTENT
**Style:** Belgian Dark Strong Ale (BJCP 26D)
**Goal:** Cherry and dark fruit notes.
**Result:** "Amazing cherry smell and flavor."

## FERMENTABLES
17 lb Pale Malt
11 oz Caramunich II
11 oz Caramunich III
1 lb Dark Candi Sugar (Split Addition)
  - 0.3 lb (30%) @ 10 min boil
  - 0.7 lb (70%) @ High Krausen (after ~40% attenuation)

## HOPS
1.0 oz Hallertauer (4.8% AA) - 60 min
1.0 oz Styrian Goldings (5.4% AA) - 60 min
0.55 oz Hallertauer (4.8% AA) - 15 min
0.55 oz Styrian Goldings (5.4% AA) - 15 min

## YEAST
**Strain:** WLP540 Abbey IV Ale Yeast (Rochefort)
**Starter:** 2 packs in 2L starter, stir plate for 3 days with nutrient.
**Pitch:** Pitched entire 2L (no decant).

## WATER PROFILE
0.035 oz Gypsum
0.113 oz Calcium Chloride
4 ml Phosphoric Acid (Added to Kettle)

## MASH & BOIL
- **Kettle Volume:** 8.3 gal
- **Pre-boil Volume:** 7.1 gal
- **Pre-boil Gravity:** 1.073
- **Boil Time:** 60 min
- **Post-boil Gravity:** 1.088
- **Additions:** Whirlfloc @ 10 min

## FERMENTATION SCHEDULE
1. **Pitch:** 70°F for 3 days.
2. **Rise:** Free rise with 80°F ceiling.
   - *Log:* Temp was low on Day 3, manually raised to 75°F and held for 7 days.
3. **Feeding:** Add remaining 70% Candi Sugar + 2g Fermaid-O when 40% sugar is consumed.
4. **Conditioning:** 6 day slow ramp down to 46°F.

## COACH NOTES & QUESTIONS
- **Success Factor (The "Save"):** Raising temp to 75°F when it dropped on Day 3 was critical. It prevented a stall and drove the "cherry" ester profile.
- **Sugar Strategy:** The 30/70 split worked perfectly to aid attenuation.
- **Acid Addition:** 4ml Phosphoric in kettle likely smoothed the bitterness and improved protein break. Keep this.
- **Process Improvement:** Pitching the full 2L starter added ~10% oxidized wort volume. **Next time:** Cold crash starter and decant (pour off liquid) to improve flavor purity.

### Discussion & Analysis

You nailed the "Dark Strong" profile with the cherry notes. Here is my breakdown of your specific questions and process:

#### 1. The Phosphoric Acid Question ("Was this needed?")
You added **4ml Phosphoric Acid** to the kettle.
*   **The Science:** Boil pH should ideally be **5.1–5.2**.
   *   If pH is too high (>5.4): Bitterness gets harsh/coarse, and color darkens excessively (Maillard reactions).
   *   If pH is too low (<5.0): Hop utilization drops, and the beer can taste tart.
*   **The Verdict:** With 17 lbs of Pale Malt and RO-ish water (very low salts), your mash pH was likely naturally around 5.4–5.6. Adding 4ml of acid to the kettle likely brought the boil pH down to the "sweet spot" of 5.2.
*   **Answer:** **Yes, it probably helped.** It likely smoothed out the bitterness and improved the "break" (protein coagulation). If the beer tastes smooth and not "scratchy," the acid did its job.

#### 2. The Fermentation "Save"
*   **Action:** You noticed low temps on Day 3 and forced it to 75°F.
*   **Impact:** This was a **critical success move**. Belgian yeast strains (like Trappist High Gravity) often "stall" if they drop temp mid-fermentation. By pushing it to 75°F, you ensured the yeast finished the job and produced those desired "cherry/fruit" esters. If you had left it at 70°F or lower, it might have stalled at 1.030 and tasted cloying.

#### 3. The Sugar Split
*   Adding 70% of the sugar during fermentation is excellent technique. It keeps the osmotic pressure lower at the start (happier yeast) and gives them a "dessert" to wake them up later. This helps dry out a big beer like this.

#### 4. Missing Info (To Fix in File)
*   **Yeast Strain:** Do you recall the specific yeast? (e.g., WLP530, Wyeast 3787, Imperial B48?)
*   **Hop Timing:** I assumed the first 1.0 oz Styrian Goldings was at **60 min** based on the grouping. Is that correct?
